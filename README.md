Twitter Bot written in Java that tweets/posts about world news, natural
disasters, etc.

Building this project provides an oppurtunity to learn the 
* Twitter API.
* RSS/Atom feeds.
* OAuth
* ...more as ideas come to me...

Dependencies:
* rome-fetcher-1.0.jar

Compile:
* If you include jars in your classpath, you need to specifiy the path to
  the specific jar file.
  For example, if the jars are in the same dir as the source files:
  'javac -cp "jdom-1.1.1.jar;rome-1.0.jar" RomeLibraryExample.java'
  (If in Windows, use ; (semi-colon). If in linux, use : (colon).)
